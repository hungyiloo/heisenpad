export const welcomeMessage = (channel: string) => `Hi there! Need to send secure and temporary messages to someone? Heisenpad can help.

Type or paste something at the bottom and click [send] to broadcast a transient message to people only in the [${channel}] channel. You can change channels at the top of your screen.

Messages only "exist" between senders & receivers. There is no server logging or persisting. Delete a message and it's gone forever. Once everyone leaves the channel, all messages vanish as if they were never there.

Activate end-to-end encryption by [setting a key] at the top right of the screen. Any listeners will need the same key to read your encrypted messages.`
